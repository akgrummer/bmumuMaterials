Create Evaluation ROC curve.

1. Apply xml weights to data - with addClassBDT_Run2.C (shared with group) or addClassBDT_2016.C (your original ie before sending to group) or addClassBDT.C run 1 version

code is in /www/bmumu/Data

2. Run KSTest_EvaluationStep.cpp on lxplus (set the Tag and vBDT for input and output file names - these match step 1 names). Don't need to set hyperparameters (could delete)
in /www/bmumu/myMVA/Macros

run with root -l -b -q

could make a new folder in the bmumu/myMVAOut/EvalFolder/
I have been using dates for folder names

3. Run MultiROC_wRun1.C
