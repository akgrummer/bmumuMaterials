kept the old dates to allow the codes to work easier down the line.

rerun the construction and set the new doca variables to 3 for DOCA>3
insect condition:
bin/IsolationStudy_v19 MC16a

bin/IsolationStudy_v19 MC16d
bin/IsolationStudy_v19 MC16e

there is no v2 for data in new nTuples yet!!
all candidates:
bin/IsolationStudy_v18 2016
bin/IsolationStudy_v18 2017

need to compile with make

updated IsolationStudy_v18, IsolationStudy_v19, IsolationStudy_v16common and IsolationStudy_v16
closeTrkDOCA is corrected in the skimming step !mistake!
with the overflow bin at 3. 
UPDATE! the issue with closeTrkDOCA occured at the skimming step:
    - the commands used to be if DCA == 999, DOCA = -0.01
This has new been removed, and re-skimming re-done

IsolationStudy_v19 is for new nTuples (v1 for data, v2 for MC) 
    and uses intersect events with old nTuples, v6
IsolationStudy_v18 is for new nTuples (v1 for data, v2 for MC)
IsolationStudy_v16common is for old nTuples (v6)
    and uses intersect events with old nTuples, v6
IsolationStudy_v16 is for old nTuples (v6)

!mistake! in the skimming step the closeTrkDOCA branch was made with closeTrkDOCA/D but did not match the float initialization
so  closeTrkDOCA_comp branch is made in all four codes: IsolationStudy_v18, IsolationStudy_v19, IsolationStudy_v16common and IsolationStudy_v16

to run the commands:
. run/run_v18.sh
. run/run_v19.sh
. run/run_v16.sh
. run/run_v16common.sh


!UPDATE! in v19 and v18, 
closeTrkDOCA_LooSiHi1Pt05_201516 -> closeTrkDOCA_LooSiHi1Pt05_corc2cnt
_T0000000035_LooSiHi1Pt05_201516 -> _T0000000035_LooSiHi1Pt05_corc2cnt
