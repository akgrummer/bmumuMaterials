Before vacation to-do list
2018 Aug 15

- I have not added a ratio plot to the log scale BDT variable plots.
- I have not had a chance to look into the ROC log scale curves again to see what is happening under 18% sig. efficiency.
- I should also check on the errors for the variable efficiency plots
- I have kept the preliminary cut flow numbers in the note, but these will need to be looked into again.
