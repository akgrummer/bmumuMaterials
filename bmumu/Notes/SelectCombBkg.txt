removes PRDs (partially reconstructed decays) from MC file 
55328 events were removed

interesting point, when access the branch of strings, needed to set the address to a pointer

string *MyDecay;
inputtree->SetBranchAddress("decay",&MyDecay);

so later in the code - to access the "value" that the pointer points to use
*MyDecay
