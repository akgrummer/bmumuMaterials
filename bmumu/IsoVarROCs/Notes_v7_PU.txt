version 4 makes 4 plots (one for each pileup bin)
4 plots for variable comparisons
4 plots for ROC curves
each plot has 5 variables

new version (v5):
for B Iso:
5 plots (for each Var), each with 4 PU bins
for DOCA:
4 plots (for each Var, no <2 options), each with 4 PU bins
for NcloseTracks:
6 plots, each with 4 PU bins

with subplot of ratios

ROCs for the same 

Efficiency versus variable plots
-----------
BDT efficiency plots - all, better axis limits
BDT efficiency plots - linear scale, axis limits

Efficiency (I > 0.8) versus pileup
-----------

Outstanding:
efficiency versus variable
ROCs pileup dependence
Fix axis limits but for old variable comps and old ROC comps
